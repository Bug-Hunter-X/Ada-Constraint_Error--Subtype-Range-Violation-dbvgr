# Ada Constraint_Error Example

This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Ada: the `Constraint_Error` exception.  This exception is raised when a value violates the defined constraints of a subtype (a restricted type). 

The `bug.ada` file shows code that could potentially raise `Constraint_Error`.  The `bugSolution.ada` file provides a corrected version.
